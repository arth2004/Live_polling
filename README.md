## Development Notes

- The system uses in-memory storage for simplicity
- Session data is lost when the server restarts
- For production, consider implementing persistent storage
- The UI exactly matches the provided Figma designs
- All required features are implemented and functional

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**: Ensure both frontend (5173) and backend (3001) servers are running
2. **Socket Connection**: Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
3. **CORS Issues**: Backend includes CORS middleware for development

### Development Tips

- Use browser developer tools to monitor Socket.IO connections
- Check server console for error messages
- Restart servers if experiencing connection issues

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent database storage
- User authentication and authorization
- Poll analytics and reporting
- Multiple session management
- Export poll results
- Mobile app version
